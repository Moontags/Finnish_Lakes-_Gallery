## Project Overview

The Finnish Lakes Gallery is a web project that aims to:

- Present Finland's largest lakes with engaging, informative content.
- Offer a responsive user interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Implement a streamlined design, keeping focus on images, titles, and concise information.

Each lake page includes:

1. **A header section** with the lake's name and a brief description.
2. **A full-screen image carousel** featuring different lakes.
3. **An informational box** with key data points about each lake.

## Features and Functionality

### Language Selection

The gallery supports both Finnish and English languages. Users can switch between languages by clicking buttons located in the header:

- The language is set to Finnish by default.
- When a language is selected, the gallery dynamically updates the lake names, descriptions, and info box content based on the chosen language.
- This feature is managed using data attributes and JavaScript, allowing for seamless, real-time updates.

### Responsiveness

The gallery was built with a mobile-first approach and adapts seamlessly to both large desktop screens and smaller mobile screens. Responsive elements include:

- **Dynamic text and image sizing** for readability and visual appeal on different devices.
- **Adaptive navigation buttons and info box** that adjust position and size to prevent overlap on various screen resolutions.

### Interactive Elements

- **Carousel navigation buttons** enable users to switch between lake views with ease.
- **Informative hover effects and shadows** give a visually layered feel to the header and button elements.

### Data and Images

Images were sourced from Wikipedia and Finnish municipalitiesâ€™ websites. Each lake image is presented with accompanying data (e.g., location, area, and unique features), gathered from reliable public sources.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS** for the website's structure and design, with advanced CSS properties like `backdrop-filter` for blur effects.
- **JavaScript** for managing the image carousel, dynamically updating lake-specific information, and handling language selection.
- **Google Fonts** to enhance typography, specifically using "Roboto Serif" and "Playfair Display" for titles and descriptions.

## Project Structure and Key Stages

1. **Initial Setup and Structure**: Built the main layout and tested the general structure.
2. **Image Integration**: Added lake images and relevant data, ensuring correct resolution for responsive display.
3. **Responsive Design Development**: Used media queries to optimize text, buttons, and images for all devices.
4. **Dynamic Data Updates**: Implemented JavaScript functions to manage the lake information display across carousel slides.
5. **Language Selection Integration**: Added buttons and JavaScript functionality to toggle between Finnish and English.
6. **Styling and Finishing Touches**: Added effects for smooth transitions and hover features.

## Future Enhancements

Further additions could include more interactivity, such as map views or user-submitted lake photos.
